| Date 26-4-2020       | [Famous People Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forbes_Celebrity_100&oldid=953390047)  | Wikipedia  | For some odd reason, some Jamaican street performer was listed as the most famous person of 2019. I found this odd and sure enough according to Forbes Celebrity 100, Taylor Swift is the most famous. |
