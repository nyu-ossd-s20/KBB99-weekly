| Date 26-04-2020       | [Famous People Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forbes_Celebrity_100&oldid=953390047)  | Wikipedia  | For some odd reason, some Jamaican street performer was listed as the most famous person of 2019. I found this odd and sure enough according to Forbes Celebrity 100, Taylor Swift is the most famous. |

| Date 14-05-2020       | [Updating FreeCodeCamp Styles](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/38696)  | FreeCodeCamp  | I added parts of a custom theme to freeCodeCamp, however my pull request was rejected due to someone requesting that I make a pull request from my account. I then explained that for this class I am required to make pull requests through the OSSD branch, but I received no response :( in the past week. Perhaps in the near future when this class is finished the pull request will be accepted. |

| Ongoing | [Activados](https://github.com/KBB99/activados)  | Activados  | A web-app that connects Venezuelan immigrants with the NGO Activados Panama. Made it open-source in case someone wanted to use it for any purpose |
