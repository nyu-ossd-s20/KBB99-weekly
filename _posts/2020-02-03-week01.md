title: Week 1: Why Work on Open Source?
---

## Open Source
Are there any benefits to being small and making your code open-source? Not that I am aware of. If you're a giant company and open-source certain projects, then you can have everyone dependent on your software and have them debug/fix your problems.

## Me and Open Source (Open Source and I?)
Having worked on multiple coding projects, even leading some over the past few years, I have seen the value of open-source. Open-source allows individuals to create amazing software. If you're into machine learning I encourage you to check out FastAI and Detectron (both use Pytorch). If you want to make apps check out React Native. If you wanna gain some notoriety then create some deepfakes with Faceswap.\n
So why am I taking an open-source class? I enjoy coding classes more than almost any other, especially when I can create.
