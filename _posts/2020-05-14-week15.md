## Crazy Year

I remember in late January thinking that the Coronavirus had been scary, but believing that it would not have much of an impact on the United States. I was surprised and disappointed that NYU Shanghai had been shut down, and hence felt lucky to be in NYC. At the beginning of March we all watched as our lives changed so much so quickly. Before this crisis I was unsure as to whether or not I should continue pursuing this expensive education. Now I am completely convinced. There is no further use in continuing my studies.

Collectively society has been thrown into a state of shock. It appears that "normal" is not guaranteed. Instead it seems that we are entering into a new era. How useful college will be in this new era is yet to be seen, but I am certain that MOOCs will play a much larger role. Contributing to open source will probably become a much easier and better way of indicating skills, leaving the worth of a college degree in CS a dubious proposition at best. With this new world there are likely to be all kind of opportunities and changes. I look forward to making these changes go in the most positive direction possible. No point in continuing to waste time learning things from people who don't want to teach them, instead I'll move into the real world and find what people actually want and need.
