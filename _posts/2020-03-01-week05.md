title: Week 5 - Bloomberg
---

The man who came to speak from Bloomberg was incredibly impressive. Imagine running a system that impacts the entire world. I'm sure that it must get quite stressful sometimes, but it must nevertheless be awesome. Minimizing response time is something that can probably go on forever and I'm sure there are all kinds of brilliant people working full-time to reduce a few milli-seconds from the response time. Running a team/company that consists of incredibly talented individuals must be incredibly satisfying.

I imagine that the goal of most programmers, at least I hope it is the goal of most programmers, would be to create something that helps the entire world function more efficiently. Creating a tool that impacts everyone all the time is quite an accomplishment I applaud the entire Bloomberg team for achieving it.

Why would anyone contribute to open-source when they have the chance to create something like the Bloomberg terminal (and consequently Mike Bloomberg's wealth)?
