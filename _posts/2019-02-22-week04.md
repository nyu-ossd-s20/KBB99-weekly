title: Week 4 - Open Data
---

Today I shall be writing about my reflections of the past week. We had
guest speakers and Joanna is looking forward to learning what I thought
about the talks, the topics, what intrigued me, and what I liked and
disliked. I suppose that the talks and the topics are intricately related,
for one could not exist without the other and by speaking of all the other
prompts I am inevitably sharing my "thoughts" on the talks. So, before
I confuse whomever it is that reads these blog posts (Joanna?) let me
directly tackle the issue at hand.

I very much enjoyed observing the resources that the data-librarian uses.
A quick aside, please forgive the term data-librarian, I simply cannot
remember her proper title at the moment. Nevertheless, I found those
resources extremely interesting. I liked the way the presenters presented,
especially the data-librarian, for she made her presentation interactive
and engaging. I did not dislike anything, however I do not think that
is a valid answer. Instead I am forced to use the strong negative term
"dislike" on something. So let us say I disliked the lack of knowledge
that the presenters had for more recent data processing techniques/frame-
works. However, I do not truly dislike that, I simply use that term,
because I am forced to use that term.

Anyway, whoever's reading, I hope you enjoyed this long (mediocre?)
reflection of the past week.
