## Knowledge Sharing

This past week I've noticed that one of the most important parts of working in a group successfully is knowledge sharing. When everyone is willing to help others out and everyone is putting in their best effort, a lot can be accomplished. This is fantastic for learning and improving coding skills. People in our group always approach problems/situations differently and its always interesting to share the different solutions. I imagine that in the corporate world knowledge sharing is equally valuable. Ideally, people will always be willing to share their approach to solving problems for maximum efficiency and efficacy. I, for one, will try.
