## Working with a Group
I find that it can sometimes be difficult to work with a group, especially if we cannot get together irl.

### Challenges
Attempting to work while being surrounded by family becomes quite difficult after some time.

Attempting to balance work-life, family-life, and school-life is even more challenging haha. One would think that being quarantined would provide even more free-time, but in-between reading news and spending time with family, I find myself with less time than ever.

### Positivity

I find that most people are eager to help. This helps me to "regain my faith in humanity".

### FreeCodeCamp

Although FreeCodeCamp initially seemed like a great project to work on, I am now thinking that perhaps too many people want to work on it and there are not quite enough issues for all of them.
