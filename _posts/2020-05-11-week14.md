## Reflections on the End of the Year

As always, the end of the school year brings a strange sense of sadness, for what seemed like it would never end soon ends within a week. No matter how well accustomed I am with such endings, they always tend to have a strange effect on me. This year though, it was even more extreme. So much has changed within the past few weeks that I'm starting to believe our "old" lives will never return. New approaches are needed as our system will be facing ever increasing challenges. I'm sure that open-source will play a pivotal role in the next few years and I will continue to feel pride when contributing to open-source in whatever way I can.
