title: Week 6 - Projects
---

This past week, I found the talk extremely entertaining. Even more than that though, I enjoyed taking a look at all these open-source projects. Ideally I would like to work on one enough to actually make a significant impact that can potentially help others. Creating something that contributes to society in some way is all I'm interested in doing.
