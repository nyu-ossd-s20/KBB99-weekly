### Cool stuff

Wanna see something pretty neat? Paste the code below into a terminal.\n Note: If you have Windows override your OS and use Ubuntu instead https://ubuntu.com/.

```bash
mkdir coolStuff
cd coolStuff
git clone https://github.com/klange/nyancat.git
cd nyancat
make && cd src
./nyancat
```

Pretty cool right?
